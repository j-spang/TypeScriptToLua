## 0.19.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** All tstl-specific options should now be inside the "tstl" section in tsconfig.json (see README.md). **Root-level options are no longer supported**.
- Added a compiler API to programmatically invoke TypeScriptToLua, and to modify or extend the default transpiler. More info on the [Compiler API wiki page](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua/wiki/TypeScriptToLua-API).
- Added support for [class decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#class-decorators).

## 0.18.0

- Added support for setting array length. Doing `array.length = x` will set the length of the array to `x` (or shorter, if the starting array was shorter!).
- Added the `.name` property to all transpiled classes, so `class.name` will contain the classname as string.

## 0.17.0

- We now support source maps in the [standard JS v3 format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1&pli=1). You can generate source maps with the `--sourceMap` CLI argument, or by adding `sourceMap: true` to your tsconfig. Inline source maps are also supported with `--inlineSourceMap` CLI/tsconfig parameter.
- Also added [tstl option](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua/wiki#tstl-specific-options) `--sourceMapTraceback`, which will add an override to Lua's `debug.traceback()` to each file, so source maps will automatically be applied to Lua stacktraces (i.e. in errors).

- Made watch mode incremental.

- Added support for `Object.fromEntries`, `array.flat` and `array.flatMap`.

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Directive `@tupleReturn` should now be specified **per overload**.

- Fixed a bug where rest parameters would not transpile correctly.
- Fixed an issue with escaped backticks.
- Various small fixes function inference and array detection.

- Changed testing framework to [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).

## 0.16.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** All functions now take a `self` parameter. This means that without further action calls to declaration functions might be given an extra argument.
  - To remove the self parameter from a single function add `this: void` to its declaration:
    `declare function foo(this: void, ...)`
  - To remove the self parameter from all methods or functions in a class/interface/namespace add `/** @noSelf */`:
    `/** @noSelf */ interface Foo {`
  - To remove the self parameter from all functions in a file, add `/** @noSelfInFile */` at the top.

---

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Directive `/** @luaIterator */` should now be put on types instead of on the functions returning them.

---

- Fixed a bug breaking named class expressions.
- Fixed inconsistency between the meaning of `>>` and `>>>` in JS vs. Lua.

- Fixed issue with the moment static fields were initialized.
- Fixed issue where `undefined` as property name was not transpiled correctly.
- Various improvements to function/method self parameter inference.
- Tstl options can now be defined in their own `tstl` block in tsconfig.json. For example:

```

        "luaTarget": "JIT"
    }
}
```

- Fixed issue when redeclaring TypeScript libraries/globals.
